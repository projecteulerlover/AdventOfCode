AoC 2020 (and some earlier years) repository for Kevin An.

To run a the code for day X, type "zw $$Start^AoC2021DayX()" (eg. for day 25, write "zw $$Start^AoC2020Day25())" in the iris terminal.
The input files have been pushed as well, so this should work without fiddling with file paths.

To run the code for all days, type "zw $$PrintAllDays^AoC2021()" in the iris terminal.
